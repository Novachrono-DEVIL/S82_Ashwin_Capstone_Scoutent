# S82_Ashwin_Capstone_Scoutent


## **Project Idea**
FootballScout is a platform that allows aspiring football and cricket players to upload their **skill or match videos** for scouts, coaches, and clubs to discover and contact them. The app will have **authentication, video uploads, player profiles, and a recommendation system** to help scouts find the best talent efficiently.


## **Brief Description**
FootballScout aims to bridge the gap between **undiscovered talent** and **scouts or clubs** looking for skilled players. Users will be able to:
- **Create profiles** showcasing their skills, stats, and achievements.
- **Upload skill videos** that can be categorized by position or playing style.
- **Scouts can search/filter** players based on position, skill level, and region.
- **AI-powered recommendation system** to highlight top talents based on engagement and scout preferences.
